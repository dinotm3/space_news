Android native (kotlin) mobile application I made as a student of computer software engineering at Algebra, Zagreb.

Works as intended on Android API 26, might crash on some of the later versions because of the "experimental" annotations used for jetpack compose, 
which I did not fix because it is a student project.

- Kotlin
- Clean MVVM arhitecture
- Dependency Injection
- Jetpack Compose
- Coroutines
